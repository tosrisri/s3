I had the pleasure of working with Srinivas for more than a year on a custom developed solution for Baxter/ Baxalta (now part of shire, Inc.). I was particularly impressed by his command on UI & UX design and development and get people on board with new ideas and solutions.
Srinivasâ€™s ability to juggle multiple activities has made a dramatic difference in achieving the project goals. He is a great asset to any project/company.
