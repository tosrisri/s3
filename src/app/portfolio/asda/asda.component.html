                        <p><span>Get Early Clarifications</span> Visual Design team being a thrid party there is a
                            disconnect for the designs that we get from them
                            for UI development due ot which a lot of re-work used to happen. When we found this we
                            started
                            implementing a strategy i.e. there will be a 2 weeks gap between the design approval and
                            developemnt
                            time which saved us re-work.</p>

                            affected the back-end development because of
                            the dependency so we followed the same 2 week gap strategy so that there will not be any
                            dependency
                            from the FE team to BE team.</p>
